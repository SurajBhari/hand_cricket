# Hand Cricket 

Experience the classic hand cricket game, a nostalgic activity from your school days, now brought to life in Python.

## How to Play
When you launch the game, you'll be prompted to raise your finger, choosing from 1 to 5 fingers, each representing your run. If the CPU selects the same number of fingers, you're out. Otherwise, the count of raised fingers contributes to your score. The game persists until you are declared out. Enjoy the timeless joy of hand cricket!
